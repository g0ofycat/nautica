A specialized *OCR Model* using a **CNN** *(Convolutional Neural Network)* for semantic analysis of **LaTeX Math Expressions**, mainly used as a tool for *Autoregressive Large Language Models* to identify any errors when identifying math expression, so they can inference and solve equations better

**todo:**

train model and link cnn to a ffn architecture (https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukbl/LaTeX-OCR-dataset) or (https://huggingface.co/datasets/OleehyO/latex-formulas)
link my latex sem analyzer to this project
better interface api for autoregressive llms
